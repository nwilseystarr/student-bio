        <blockquote>I am a Bootcamp student at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp focusing on the full-stack MERN track. I have a degree in 
                    Political Science from DePaul University, and am the Executive-Director for the Model United Nations Development 
                    Organization which aims to challenge future leaders to think from a global perspective through immersive and experiential 
                    education. I am also the Chief Operating Officer at cvVentures where we work with and invest in startups and mature 
                    businesses in the medical/biotech, fintech, education, and real estate sectors in Asia and North America.

                    I have been “playing” with basic code since I was 14; however, through a project with cvVentures I really started 
                    to fall in love with the idea. It was while working on a new fin-tech app in Hong Kong where I learned more about 
                    the ins and outs of programming. I am very excited to continue on my path of continued learning through Bootcamp 
                    and my career.
